```

### Mood Model

The core model of the application is the Mood model, which contains the following fields:

- `mood`: A string indicating the user's mood (e.g., "happy", "sad", etc.).
- `notes`: Additional notes for the mood entry.
- `sentiment`: The sentiment score calculated using TextBlob.
- `created_at`: Timestamp for when the mood was logged.

### Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis feature uses the TextBlob library to analyze mood notes. The sentiment score ranges from -1.0 (negative sentiment) to 1.0 (positive sentiment).

Admin users can view the average sentiment of all users through the `/staff/` URL.

### Exporting Data

Users can export their mood history in JSON format by clicking the Export json link in `/mood_history/`. This exports all mood data for the authenticated user.

### Visualizations

The mood history page visualizes mood data using charts. It breaks down moods by their frequency and shows them in different colors
